- Everything around us uses models
- Using and thinking like models increases intellect 
- Models can be used in various ways - understand data, decide and strategise designs

## Why does modeling make us better thinkers?
- help us to better organise information - to make sense of data
- improve our ability to make accurate forecasts
- help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies
- improve our ability to design info systems, start up companies and institutions

Reasons to create models:
- To be an intelligent citizen:good models can help us do/design things in better ways,enable people to do a better job at their chosen vocation
- To think clearer
- to use and understand data
- To decide, strategise and design

How to write a model
1. Name the parts - Example: choosing a restaurant. What matters? Names of restaurants, individual people, how much money is available, time, preferences. What doesn’t matter? Clothes I am wearing.
2. Determine the relationship between the parts and how these play out - i.e. work through the logic. When doing this, you often figure that the logic plays out very different from what intuition would suggest.
3. Explore inductively by running lots of parametric studies to study the possible range of outcomes - Once you have the model you can change/add/subtract features and explore their effect.
4. Explore the possible types of outcome - equilibrium, cycle, random, complex - For example, the demand of oil probably depends on the size of an economy, and since that grows relatively smoothly around 2%/year, the demand for oil should be quite predictably sloping up. But the price of oil also depends on people’s subjective judgements, human psychology, over- and underreactions, and should thus be more complex than a nice linear curve.
5. Identify logical boundaries - There are opposite proverbs for almost anything. There are conditions for which either one of two opposite scenarios holds true, and models allow us to determine when a certain scenario is more likely to be valid.
6. Communicate with others - We can break down the complexities of a process into its relevant dependent parts, and by exploring their interactions, communicate quite clearly what we think will happen. For example, the process of voting in a democracy could be broken down into voters and candidates, and each voter’s preference is likely to arise as a result of a candidate’s likeability and his/her policy. So depending on how these two factors overlap we can communicate more clearly why we believe someone will vote in a specific way.

MODELS ARE THE MAP OF THE TERRORITORY NOT THE TERRITORY ITSELF

## Types of models
1. Embodiment approach:
- Realism
- include important parts and either strip away unnecessary dimensions and attributes
- examples: models of ecological glades, legislatures, traffic systems, model of brain

2. Analogy approach:
- Abstract
- eg. Spherical cow - to make an estimate of the amount of leather in a cowhide, we assume a spherical cow analogy approach tries to capture the essence of a process, system , or phenomenon
- When a physicist assumes away friction but otherwise makes realistic assumptions, she takes the embodiment approach. When an economist represents competing firms as different species and defines product niches, she makes an analogy.

3. Alternative reality approach:
- purposely does not represent or capture reality
- models function as analytic and computational playgrounds in which we can explore possibilities
- approach allows us to discover general insights that apply outside physical and social world
- help understand implications of real-world constraints





## Seven uses of model (REDCAPE)
### Reason:
To Reason - identify conditions and deduce logical implications
- when constructing a model, we identify important characteristics then describe parts that interact - enabling us to improve our reasoning
- we need formal logic to reveal impossibilities and possibilities
- we can derive precise and unexpected relationships - can discover the conditionality of our intuitions

### Explain
To Explain - provide testable explanations for empirical phenomena
- models provide clear logical explanations for empirical phenomena
- eg. economic models explain price movements and market shares. physics models explain the rate of falling objects and the shape of trajectories
- A model can explain the current price of pork belly futures and why prices rose over the past six months
- Can also explain shape: models of diffusion ideas, tech

### Design
To Design - choose features of information systems, start-ups, government, agencies, etc
- models aid in design by providing frameworks within which we can contemplate the implications of choices
- eg. engineers use models to design supply chains, computer scientists use models to design web protocols

### Communicate
To Communicate - relate knowledge and understandings
- by creating common representations, models improve communication
- model require formal definitions of relevant features and their relationships that we can then communicate with precision

### Act
To Act- guide policy choices and strategic actions
- Good actions require good models (eg. govs, corporations use models to guide actions)
- On most important actions, decision-makers use sophisticated models
- models are linked to data

### Predict
To Predict - make numerical and categorical predictions of future and unknown phenomena
- models have long been used to predict (eg. weather forecasters, consultants)
- As data has become more available and granular - use of models has grown
- eg. twitter feeds and internet searches are used to predict consumer trends and social uprisings

### Explore
To Explore - investigate possibilities and hypotheticals
- We can use models to explore intuitions and possibilities
- Explorations can be policy-related: what if we make all city buses free? what if we let students choose which assignments determine their grades?
- each of these hypotheticals can be explored with models

### Wisdom Hierarchy
1. At the bottom of the hierarchy lies data
2. Information names and partitions data into categorie
3. Knowledge organises information
4. Atop the hierarchy lies wisdom, the ability to identify and apply relevant knowledge
5. Wisdom can consist of selecting the correct knowledge or model



# Week 3

There are different models as to how people behave:
- Rational: Based on assumption that people behave such as to optimise for their goals. There is an objective function (market share, votes, profits etc). People then optimise to maximise it.
- Behavioural: Model people as close as possible to how they really behave, i.e. include their biases and heuristics. Don't assume they are rational, observe how they behave (and in fact they behave irrationally in predictive ways), and then use those observations to predict.
- Rule-based: Use psychology to figure out certain rules that people seem to be using and how this predicts that they will act. The Schelling model of segregation (Week 7) is a classic, simple rule-based model.

Rational models have come under a lot of criticism because of biases and heuristics literature. It is still a useful tool to have in your pocket. Assumes:
- a rational person
- a clear objective, goal, purpose, values etc
- ability to calculate expected benefits
- ability to optimise/maximise the outcome

So when do we typically see rational behaviour?
Generally when:
- the stakes are high
- there are repeated decisions
- we have groups making decisions
- the choices are easy to make

Behavioural (irrational models):
- In the rational model, you have objective functions and you make an optimal choice under this rationality.
- But there are recurring observations from psychology that we make systematic errors in rational thinking. There is also some neurological evidence to support this.
- In “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, Danny Kahnemann makes the point that we have two different types of thinking systems, one fast that is intuitive, and one slow that uses rigorous thinking.
- Examples: Prospect theory, hyperbolic discounting, status quo bias, anchoring bias etc.

Rule-based models
- People follow very basic rules
- For example, in the Schelling segregation model, people decided to move or stay depending purely on how many like-minded individuals lived around them.
- There are four different variations: the rules can be fixed or adaptive, and the choice can be decision-based (sole agent) or a game (multiple agents). 
- In games, for example, my payoff depends on what other people do, and so having adaptive rules might be better, but if I am a genius and the others not so clever, then a fixed rule may be best.

Fixed: Fixed rule, e.g. take the straight line to travel between two points, i.e. the most direct route. Fixed strategy, e.g. divide evenly, tit-for-tat, etc..

Adaptive:
- Gradient-based method: people start off doing something and then tinker around with the recipe, moving in the correct direction to reach the optimum, that is, up a hill. In a random method, you would randomly add other stuff/take away stuff to haphazardly optimise.
- Evolutionary strategy: Either an adaptive response where I watch another person and then think what is the best rational response, or mimicry, where I just copy what other people are doing well, and sometimes try something new.

Sometimes optimal rules are very simple, and in that case, it would make sense to use a rule- based approach. Simple rules can often be exploited though, if other agents in a game realise what your rule is and then just exploit it (classic case of a blind rule that wasn’t updated when reality changed).

Rules are great because they are easy to model, they can capture a lot of the optimality effects in a very simple rule, but they are somehow ad hoc and are exploitable.

Decision Making
We now turn to decision models of how people make or should make decisions. We are ultimately doing this for two reasons:
1. Normative reasons: Use models to come up with prescriptions that allow us to make better decisions.
2. Positive reasons: Use models to predict the behaviour of others, and why people make the decisions they do.

Fundamentally, there are two classes of problems:
- Multi-criterion problems: We need to weigh multiple options against each other.
- Under uncertainty: Risk-benefit analysis in terms of probability e.g. decision trees, or value of information. This latter option attempts to measure how much a piece of information is really worth to us in making a decision.

Signaling models
These models identify conditions under which people send costly signals to reveal information or their type. A person might signal wealth by purchasing an expensive piece of art, physical stamina by climbing a mountain, or empathy by posting support for causes on social media. Signaling to reveal status has always been a part of human nature.
Final thoughts: the signaling model can be applied widely. 

# Week 4

## System Dynamic
- analyse systems with feedback and interdependencies
- used to model ecologies, economic, supply chains, production processes
- improve capacity to think through logical chains that include negative and positive feedbacks
- SDM consists of sources, sinks, stocks, flows, rates and constants

Positive feedback occurs when an increase in variable or attribute produces an additional increase in that same variable. Success breeds success, sales lead to more sales, and, in the case of academic papers and patents, citations generate more citations.

Negative feedback dampens trends. Negative feedback often produces desirable properties. They can prevent bubbles and crashes. When we eat, our brain receives signals to stop eating. When a company’s profits increase beyond normal economic returns, competitors enter, reducing those profits and preventing the company from exploiting customers. negative feedback contributes to system-level robustness.

- A system must be dynamic (constantly changing) and evolving (having emergent properties
- Systems are defined by their interrelationship and functionality/potential

Iceberg Model is a systems thinking tool designed to help an individual or group discover the patterns of behaviour, supporting structures and mental models that underlie a particular event

### Causal Loop Diagram
- CLD is a way of graphically representing the relationships between a number of variables
- The arrows,+,-,indicates the direction which is is the influencer/influences

In order to understand a system you must define the system boundary - what is it that you are exploring then once u have defined your system arena you look further into the topic.

### Fundamental modes of interaction
1. Exponential growth
- Arising in self-reinforcing loops
- Describes graph of any variable in that loop overtime
2. Goal-seeking
- Process by which a system naturally reaches a “desired” state
3. Oscillation
- Arises from time delays

### System archetypes
1. Drifting goals
2. Escalation
3. Fixes that fail
4. Growth and Underinvestment
5. Limits to success
6. Shifting the burden/addiction
7. Success to the successful
8. Tragedy of the commons

### Predator-Prey model
- Ecological model that captures the relationship between the number of prey and number of predators.
- Includes two positive feedbacks
- And one negative feedback

### Networks
Structure of Networks: nodes and edges
- Nodes: individual entities which are connected by edges
- Edges: directed or undirected directions of influence

Network function
- When modes interact they are mostly thinking about themselves
- When these preferences interact on microlevel, they can lead emergent properties or functionalities o n macro level

## Agent Based Models
This model studies the agents behaviour within a given environment and how the environment reacts to the agent. An agent based model must consist of three elements from the system to work:
- Agent: a unique element that interacts with the system
- Environment: where the agent operates
- Rules: set of law that agent has to work in

# Week 5
## Probability distributions
### Aggregation
In the social sciences, many models are written as agents + behaviours = outcomes, where the +- sign represents the aggregation of two different entities. For more interesting/complex phenomena, aggregation is often more complicated than arithmetic aggregation, i.e. via 1 + 1 = 2. Often, aggregation is nonlinear, for example, tolerant people in the micro can still lead to macro-level segregation (as per Schelling’s segregation model).

In fact, aggregation can lead to counter-intuitive effects when properties emerge as a result of interactions. One issue with reductionist science is that when you study individual agents or particles they may behave one way in isolation, but when they are all interconnected we can observe some new phenomenon. For example, a single water molecule can be easily understood in terms of all the chemical properties. But from understanding a single water molecule we cannot appreciate the property of wetness, which only arises when multiple molecules are bonded together and our hand slices them apart. The wetness emerges as an emergent property of the interaction of many water molecules.

Aggregation of action allows us to:
1. Predict points and understand data.
2. Understand complicated patterns and outcomes that arise from simple rules. Indeed, very simple rules can lead to very complex outcomes, just taking binary on/off rules you can have equilibrium, periodicity, chaos and complexity.
3. Work through logic. If you like A more than B, and B more than C, then how do these preferences aggregate?

What is probability and why do we even care?
Probability is about interpreting and understanding the random events of life, and since we live in absolute randomness (even if we try to believe we don’t), its usefulness becomes quite clear. Probability is the long-term chance that a certain outcome will occur from some random process. It basically tells you how often different kinds of events will happen.
 
Some real life examples of the use of probabilities are:
- Finance
- Weather forecast
- Insurance
- Sports

Probability distributions
A probability distribution is the distribution or representation of values that a random variable may have. It represents how likely one could find the possible values of a random variable.
Suppose you draw a random sample and measure the weights of the different people. You can create a distribution of weights. The distribution is useful when you need to know which outcomes are most likely, the spread of values, and the likelihood of different results.

In other words, a probability distribution is a list of all of the possible outcomes of a random variable, along with its corresponding probability values.A probability distribution links each outcome of a random variable or process with its probability of occurrence.
Types of random variables:
Two major types:
Discrete random variables: are the ones that have either a finite or countably number of possible outcomes. You calculate its value by counting.
Continuous random variables: has an uncountable infinite number of possible values. You calculate its value by measuring.
Probability distributions give you the power of prediction
There are probability distribution models that help you predict outcomes in specific situations. When certain conditions are met, these probability distributions models assist you to calculate each outcome probability, the long-term average outcomes, and estimate the variability in the results of random variables, without the need to have all the actual outcomes of the random variables you’re interested in.
This means that there is a way of generalising the results of your limited analysis on random variables to broader behaviours, which will help you to save time, money and reach more confident results. Lots of probability distributions models exist for different situations, and the key point is that you have to select the right one that fits your data and helps you explain what you’re trying to understand.
In simple terms, a probability distribution model is a guide you use to fit a random variable in order to generalise its behaviour. These models have a mathematical background, and can be very picky. For them to work properly, the random variable you are trying to fit in must meet different assumptions so that the outcomes of the model have the correct probabilities, and also so that you can test and validate the model against real data from the random variable.
Final thoughts
Probability distributions help to model our world, enabling us to obtain estimates of the probability that a certain event may occur, or estimate the variability of occurrence. They are a common way to describe, and possibly predict, the probability of an event.
The main challenge is to define the characteristics of the variables whose behaviour we are trying to describe, since it’s necessary to identify what distribution should be applied to a model of a particular process.
The identification of the right distribution will allow a proper application of a model (for instance, the standardised normal distribution) that would easily predict the probability of a given event.
In the following sections, we will study two types of distributions that are relevant for understanding human behaviour and socio-technical systems—the normal distribution and long-tailed distributions.

# Week 6

What have I learnt this week?

Path Dependence
what happens right now depends on the proceedings moments (paths we took to get here)
The sequences of previous events effects the long term outcomes including equilibrium

 
Independent: Outcome doesn’t depend on starting point or what happens along the way
Initial conditions: Outcome depends on starting state
Path dependent: Outcome probabilities depend upon the sequence of past outcomes
Phat dependence: Outcome probabilities depend upon past outcomes but not their order.
 
path dependent outcomes: outcome in a given period, the outcome depends on the path
path dependent equilibrium: the equilibrium in the long run depends on the path
Growth: concavity and convexity
Nonlinear functions can curve downward or upward, they can form s-shape, kink, jump and squiggle

Why are some countries rich and others are poor? We will answer this question using four models of economic growth:
Exponential growth: rate at which money grows
Economic growth using a primitive economy growth model: the model shows that there are limits to economic growth because without innovation growth stops
Solow’s growth model: incorporates innovation and shows that it is important because of multiplier effects
Extensions: what enables growth to continue over time?
Convexity
Convex functions have an increasing slope: functions value increases by a larger amount as we increase a variable’s value
Concavity
Concave functions having slopes that decrease: functions with positives slops exhibit diminishing returns

# Week 7

What have I learnt this week?

3 types of emergent behaviours:
Peer Effects and Social Contagion
Coordination and Culture
Social Learning

How things spread:
Schelling’s Segregation Model
Granovetter’s Riot Model
Standing Ovation Model

How we coordinate/A model of culture
Pure coordination games
Axelrod’s culture model

Social learning:
Replicator Dynamics Models

Schelling’s Segregation Model: Schelling set out to study the following empirical phenomenon: There is widespread racial and income segregation in most parts of the developed world.

Key takeaways
Micro-motives does not equal Macro-behaviour
Social contagion driven by high variance rather than mean behaviour
Need to know the distribution of behaviours
Three models are extremely fertile, flexible 
Can be applied to stimulate/hinder contagion

Company culture can more simply be described as the shared ethos of an organisation. It’s the way people feel about the work they do, the values they believe in, where they see the company going and what they’re doing to get it there. Collectively, these traits represent the personality - or culture - of an organisation. 

Culture can be modelled as a series of pure coordination games
Culture is multiple and consistent coordination
Small amounts of error can lead to large amounts of heterogeneity
